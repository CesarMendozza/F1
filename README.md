Data Analysis on formula one stats

CONTEXT
Formula One (also Formula 1 or F1 and officially the FIA Formula One World Championship) is the highest class of single-seat auto racing that is sanctioned 
by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA). Legends like Fangio, Lauda, and Hamilton the sport has grown to a global scale that appeals to A list 
celebrities to the cool nerds that want to make the car got milliseconds faster. This is where machine learning comes in. I want to start with linear regression model 
and see if there really is a need to get more complex. 

CONTENT
The dataset contains data from 1950 to 2017. We are given tables that consist of race, lap, and pit stops to name a few.
A relatively clean dataset, the beauty of kaggle. 

Acknowledgements
The data was downloaded from http://ergast.com/mrd/ at the conclusion of the 2017 season. The data was originally gathered and published to the public domain by 
Chris Newell.

Inspiration
I think this dataset offers an exciting insight into a billion industry, enjoyed by hundreds of millions of viewers all over the world. 
So since there werent any races to watch, I explored the other side of the F1 World.
